                These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the FlightPlus mobile application, website, and related services ("Services"). By creating an account or using the Services, you agree to these Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Eligibility & Account Registration</h2>
            <p>
                You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) and capable of entering into a binding contract to use the Services. When you create an account, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Subscription Plans & Payments</h2>
            <p>
                FlightPlus offers a free Explorer tier and a paid Insighter tier ($4.99/month or $49.99/year) with a 7-day free trial. Subscriptions are purchased through Apple's in-app purchase system and are subject to Apple's terms and conditions. Prices are displayed in your local currency (converted from U.S. dollars) and may vary by region. Taxes may apply.

            <h2>7. Termination & Account Deletion</h2>

            <h3>7.1 Account Termination</h3>
            <p>
                You may delete your account at any time through the app's settings or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@flightplus.ai">info@flightplus.ai</a>. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time, with or without cause, including for violations of these Terms or legal obligations. Upon termination, your license to use the Services ends, but sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive will remain in effect.
            </p>

            <h3>7.2 Immediate Data Deletion Upon Account Deletion</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>When you confirm account deletion in the app, FlightPlus will immediately and permanently delete the following data:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>Personal Profile Data:</strong> Your name, email address, profile photo, display name, and all other account information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flight History:</strong> All flight records, including flight numbers, routes, dates, aircraft details, seat-side indicators, captions, hashtags, and journey notes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Private Aerial Photos:</strong> All photos you have marked as private, including associated metadata (timestamps, GPS coordinates, altitude, heading, and flight tracking data).</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Trip Photos:</strong> All imported trip photos and their associated metadata (device timestamps, time-zone offsets, and flight linkages).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                This deletion occurs immediately upon your confirmation and is permanent and irreversible. Once your account is deleted, we cannot recover any of your data. Please ensure you have exported or backed up any data you wish to retain before initiating account deletion.
            </p>

            <h3>7.3 Public Aerial Photos</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Published public aerial photos will be deleted from FlightPlus upon account deletion.</strong> By publishing photos as public, you have granted FlightPlus a license to display and use those photos as described in Section 3.2. However, if any public photos have been incorporated into other products, services, or marketing materials prior to your account deletion, we will not trace or remove those instances. Your personal attribution (name, profile photo, and account association) will be removed from any remaining public photos upon account deletion.
            </p>

            <h3>7.4 Exceptions to Data Deletion</h3>
            <p>
                Notwithstanding the above, we may retain limited information as required by applicable law, to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for legitimate business purposes such as fraud prevention and security. Any retained data will be anonymized or aggregated where possible and will not be used to identify you personally.
            </p>
