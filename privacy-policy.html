            <p>
                FlightPlus ("we," "us," or "our") provides tools that let aviation enthusiasts document, organize, and share aerial photography, including map-based explorers, flight journals, and signature frames. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you use the FlightPlus mobile app, website, and related services (collectively, the "Services").
            </p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>1.1 Account & Profile Information</h3>
            <p>
                When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, password, and any optional profile information you choose to provide, such as a profile photo or display name. We also track your subscription tier (Explorer or Insighter) and subscription status.
            </p>

            <h3>1.2 Flight & Journey Data</h3>
            <p>
                We collect information about your flights, including flight numbers, routes, dates, aircraft details, seat-side indicators (left/right/front views), captions, hashtags, and any notes you provide about your journey.
            </p>

            <h3>1.3 Photos & Media</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Public Photos:</strong> When you mark photos as public, they are visible to all FlightPlus users and may be liked, viewed, and shared. Public photos may be used by FlightPlus in future products, features, or marketing materials. We collect metadata associated with public photos, including timestamps, altitude, heading, GPS coordinates, flight tracking data (FR24), and engagement metrics (likes, views).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Private Photos:</strong> Photos you mark as private are only visible to you. Private photos are not shared with other users and will not be used by FlightPlus for any purpose other than displaying them to you within the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Trip Photos:</strong> If you choose to import personal trip photos, we collect the images and associated metadata (device timestamp, time-zone offset) to link them to specific flights.
            </p>

            <h3>1.4 Device & Usage Data</h3>
            <p>
                We collect device identifiers, operating system version, app version, log files, and event data (e.g., feature usage, crashes) to help us diagnose issues, improve performance, and understand how you use the Services.
            </p>

            <h3>1.5 Location, Camera, and Media Library Access</h3>
            <p>
                We request access to your device's location services (foreground and background) to accurately tag aerial photos with GPS coordinates and help you identify landmarks visible from your flight. We request camera access to allow you to capture aerial photos directly within the app. We request photo library access to allow you to import existing photos into your flight albums.
            </p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

                <li><strong>Public Sharing:</strong> Display public photos to other users, enable likes and comments, and allow sharing via links. Public photos may be used by FlightPlus in future products, features, or marketing materials.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Private photos remain accessible only to you unless you change their visibility settings.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>

                <li><strong>Location/Camera Permissions:</strong> You can revoke location or camera access at any time through your device's privacy settings, though this may limit certain features.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                We retain your personal data for as long as you maintain an account or as needed to provide the Services. We may retain certain information after account deletion to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Security</h2>
            <p>
                We employ technical and organizational safeguards to protect your data, including encryption in transit, access controls, and user-scoped storage segregation. However, no system is 100% secure. If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, please contact us immediately.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                FlightPlus is not intended for users under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
            </p>

            <h2>8. International Use</h2>

                FlightPlus operates from the United States. By using the Services, you consent to the processing and storage of your data in the U.S. and other countries where we or our service providers operate.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Updates to this Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you via in-app notice or email. Your continued use of the Services after changes take effect means you accept the revised policy.
            </p>
