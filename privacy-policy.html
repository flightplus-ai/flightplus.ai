            <p>
                FlightPlus ("we," "us," or "our") provides tools that let aviation enthusiasts document, organize, and share aerial photography, including map-based explorers, flight journals, and signature frames. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you use the FlightPlus mobile app, website, and related services (collectively, the "Services").
            </p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>1.1 Account & Profile Information</h3>
            <p>
                When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, password, and any optional profile information you choose to provide, such as a profile photo or display name. We also track your subscription tier (Explorer or Insighter) and subscription status.
            </p>

            <h3>1.2 Flight & Journey Data</h3>
            <p>
                We collect information about your flights, including flight numbers, routes, dates, aircraft details, seat-side indicators (left/right/front views), captions, hashtags, and any notes you provide about your journey.
            </p>

            <h3>1.3 Photos & Media</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Public Photos:</strong> When you mark photos as public, they are visible to all FlightPlus users and may be liked, viewed, and shared. Public photos may be used by FlightPlus in future products, features, or marketing materials. We collect metadata associated with public photos, including timestamps, altitude, heading, GPS coordinates, flight tracking data, and engagement metrics (likes, views).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Private Photos:</strong> Photos you mark as private are only visible to you. Private photos are not shared with other users and will not be used by FlightPlus for any purpose other than displaying them to you within the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Trip Photos:</strong> If you choose to import personal trip photos, we collect the images and associated metadata (device timestamp, time-zone offset) to link them to specific flights. Trip photos are not shared with other users and will not be used by FlightPlus for any purpose other than displaying them to you within the app.
            </p>

            <h3>1.4 Device & Usage Data</h3>
            <p>
                We collect device identifiers, operating system version, app version, log files, and event data (e.g., feature usage, crashes) to help us diagnose issues, improve performance, and understand how you use the Services.
            </p>

            <h3>1.5 Location, Camera, and Media Library Access</h3>
            <p>
                We request access to your device's location services (foreground and background) to accurately tag aerial photos with GPS coordinates and help you identify landmarks visible from your flight. We request camera access to allow you to capture aerial photos directly within the app. We request photo library access to allow you to import existing photos into your flight albums, and save processed photos to your photo library.
            </p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
            <ol>

                <li><strong>Public Sharing:</strong> Display public photos to other users, enable likes and comments, and allow sharing via links. Public photos may be used by FlightPlus in future products, features, or marketing materials.</li>

Upon confirming account deletion, all your personal data (including private aerial photos, personal trip photos, and published public aerial photos) will be immediately and permanently removed as described in Section 5 below.

                <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt out of marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in any email. You can disable push notifications in your device settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Location/Camera Permissions:</strong> You can revoke location or camera access at any time through your device's privacy settings, though this may limit certain features.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Retention During Active Use</h3>
            <p>
                We retain your personal data for as long as you maintain an active account or as needed to provide the Services.
            </p>

            <h3>5.2 Immediate Data Deletion Upon Account Deletion</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>When you confirm account deletion in the app, FlightPlus will immediately and permanently delete the following personal data:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>Personal Profile Data:</strong> Your name, email address, password, profile photo, display name, subscription information, and all other account-related information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flight History:</strong> All flight records you have created, including flight numbers, routes, departure and arrival dates, aircraft details, seat-side indicators (left/right/front views), captions, hashtags, and any personal notes about your journeys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Private Aerial Photos:</strong> All photos you have marked as private, including all associated metadata such as timestamps, GPS coordinates, altitude, heading, and flight tracking data (FR24). <strong>Private photos are deleted immediately upon account deletion confirmation.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Trip Photos:</strong> All imported personal trip photos, including device timestamps, time-zone offsets, and any linkages to specific flights.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                This deletion occurs immediately upon your confirmation and is permanent and irreversible. Once your account is deleted, we cannot recover your personal data. We recommend exporting or backing up any data you wish to retain before initiating account deletion.
            </p>

            <h3>5.3 Public Aerial Photos</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Published public aerial photos will be deleted from FlightPlus upon account deletion.</strong> When you publish a photo as public, you grant FlightPlus a license to display, use, and retain that photo as described in Section 2. However, if any public photos have been incorporated into other products, services, or marketing materials prior to your account deletion, we will not trace or remove those instances. Your personal attribution (name, profile photo, and account association) will be removed from any remaining public photos upon account deletion.
            </p>

            <h3>5.4 How to Delete Your Account</h3>
            <p>
                You can delete your account through the FlightPlus app's settings menu. The deletion process requires you to confirm your decision within the app. Once you confirm, your data will be deleted immediately and you will be logged out. You may also request account deletion by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@flightplus.ai">info@flightplus.ai</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>5.5 Limited Retention After Deletion</h3>
            <p>
                Notwithstanding the above, we may retain limited, anonymized, or aggregated information after account deletion solely for the following purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Compliance with legal obligations (e.g., tax records, legal proceedings)</li>
                <li>Resolution of disputes or enforcement of our Terms of Service</li>
                <li>Prevention of fraud, abuse, or security threats</li>
                <li>Aggregate analytics that do not identify individual users</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Any data retained for these purposes will not be used to identify you personally and will be deleted when no longer necessary.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Security</h2>
            <p>
                We employ technical and organizational safeguards to protect your data, including encryption in transit, access controls, and user-scoped storage segregation. However, no system is 100% secure. If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, please contact us immediately.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                FlightPlus is not intended for users under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
            </p>

            <h2>8. International Use</h2>
            <p>
                FlightPlus is operated by a company registered in Singapore. By using the Services, you consent to the processing and storage of your data in Singapore and other countries where we or our service providers operate, which may include countries with different data protection laws than those in your jurisdiction.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Updates to this Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you via in-app notice or email. Your continued use of the Services after changes take effect means you accept the revised policy.
            </p>
